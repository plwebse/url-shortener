Goal

Create a simple link shortening and analytics web service similar to bit.ly.

In order to take over the world and beat competitors, we need the service that provides the following functionality:

1) Ability to shorten the link

Include validation against malformed links
2) Ability to customise the link (bit.ly/<this-part>)

Make sure there are no duplicates
Make sure that <this-part> does not include abusive words (provide hard-coded dictionary with N random words)
3) Ability to track link visits (time, ip address and country).

Country is resolved against some geo-encoding service such as ip-api.com or freegeoip.net
Implement protection against network latency with Hystrix
Make sure that a link is eventually geo-encoded, even if geo-encoding service is slow or unresponsive during the link visit
4) Ability to get all shortened links via web api

5) Ability to get all visits for a given link via web api

It must be clear from the response whether geo-encoding is pending
Link visits must appear in chronological order
Other concerns

(optional) Likely there will be some generic infrastructural code. With VeriPacks, ensure that infra never references other layers such as domain and application
Demonstrate application usage with high-level acceptance tests
Make sure that both application and tests run in embedded mode. In other words, it must run on a laptop with nothing but Java and Docker installed
Push application to GitHub
Provide simple and concise setup instructions
Express major design decisions you have made on wiki
FAQ

â€“ there is no need in UI. Web API is the app's UI.
